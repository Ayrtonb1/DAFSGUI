# DAFSGUI
A python-based program for diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS) analysis. Optional UI or alternative .py files for the isolation and separation of f" from data output from a DAFS experiment.
Using this program, any interested user should, with the help of supporting documentation, conduct DAFS analysis of any sample to isolate site or spatially-specific absorption spectra from crystallographically inequivalent sites with relative ease, and with minimal user input.
